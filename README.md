# Amazon-Clone
Hi everyone! I’m thrilled to share that I’ve started my journey in frontend development and have learned HTML and CSS.

To put my skills into practice, I built a project—a clone of Amazon’s homepage. Here are the highlights of what I created:

Header and Navigation Bar: Features a search bar, cart icon, and user account links, styled to resemble Amazon’s UI.

Hero Banner: A vibrant and visually engaging banner showcasing deals and offers.

Product Categories: Organized sections for categories like Gaming Accessories, Health & Personal Care, and Electronics, each with images and clickable "See more" links.

Footer Section: Includes multiple columns with helpful links, along with a "Back to Top" button for easy navigation.

This project taught me how to structure layouts and style components to replicate real-world websites. While it’s just the beginning, I’m proud of what I’ve built and excited to learn more!
